# NixOS Config for Framework 16 laptop (AMD)

configuration.nix and suspend-then-hibernate.nix should be automagically portable to other systems.
Do not try to use my hardware-configuration.nix and network-mounts.nix -- These are specific to my hardware and should be auto-generated by your system.
  
## General Stuff
- KDE Plasma & Wayland
- Some magic to make suspend-to-hibernate work
- Dedicated swap partition (swap is necessary for hibernation)
- Touchegg to make touchpad gestures work
- tlp to double your battery life (Switch to ppd if it doesn't)
- fprintd for the fingerprint reader
- Bluetooth
- Pipewire
- Cursor fix

## Stuff you might not want in your own config
- Tailscale
- Mullvad
- vscode
- nix-software-center (This thing kinda sucks)
- flatpak (Good for apps that need to update requently, like discord and telegram
